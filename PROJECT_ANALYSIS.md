## 🔴 Problem Statement

### The Crisis in Canadian Healthcare (& Global Context)

**Current State:**
- **6 million Canadians** don't have a family doctor
- **28.6 weeks average wait time** for treatment in Canada
- **1.4 million Canadians** currently waiting on procedures (many due to missed follow-up calls)
- Clinic staff spend hours manually:
  - Reviewing lab reports
  - Calling patients one-by-one
  - Scheduling appointments
  - Managing paperwork
  - Handling insurance verifications

**Root Causes:**
1. **Manual processes** — Lab results require manual review and phone calls (labor-intensive, prone to delays)
2. **Scheduling chaos** — Booking appointments is tedious; patients miss follow-ups
3. **Staff burnout** — Front desk & nurses spend >40% of time on administrative tasks instead of patient care
4. **Lost revenue** — Missed follow-ups = missed diagnoses, delayed treatments, compliance issues
5. **Scalability gap** — As patient volume grows, clinics can't hire enough staff to keep up

**Impact Metrics:**
- Clinics waste **~40-50% of staff time** on scheduling, calling, and paperwork
- Patients miss follow-ups because **no one called them** (or they missed the call)
- Clinics lose revenue from **incomplete treatment cycles** and compliance gaps

## 👥 Who It Helps (Target Sector)

### Primary Users:
1. **Clinics & Medical Practices** (any specialty)
   - Family medicine
   - Cardiology, oncology, endocrinology
   - Urgent care centers
   - Diagnostic clinics

2. **Healthcare Staff:**
   - Doctors/clinicians (need less admin time)
   - Front-desk staff (reduce call volume)
   - Lab coordinators (automate result follow-up)
   - Insurance/billing teams

3. **Patients** (indirect benefit)
   - Faster appointment access
   - Proactive follow-up communication
   - Reduced wait times
   - Better care continuity

### Geographic Focus:
- **Primary:** Canada 🇨🇦 (hackathon project, specific Canadian healthcare context)
- **Scalable to:** US, UK, Australia, EU (any regulated healthcare system)

### Clinic Size:
- **Mid-to-large practices** (20+ doctors, 100+ patients/day) get maximum ROI
- Also useful for **urgent care**, **diagnostic centers**, **specialist clinics**

## ✅ How Clarus Solves It

### 1. **Visual Workflow Builder** (No-code automation)
Doctors drag-and-drop nodes to create workflows:
- **Triggers:** Lab results received, appointment missed, prescription expiring, new patient registered
- **Conditions:** Check insurance, patient age, result values, medication list, appointment history
- **Actions:** Call patient, send SMS, schedule appointment, create lab order, send notification, assign to staff
- **Outputs:** Generate transcripts, create reports, send summaries

**Benefit:** Workflows are saved as JSON graphs (React Flow format), allowing reusable templates for common clinic scenarios.

---

### 2. **AI Voice Calls** (Conversational AI via ElevenLabs)
**How it works:**
- Lab results come in → Workflow triggers
- System calls patient using **ElevenLabs Conversational AI agent**
- Agent delivers **personalized message** (patient name, doctor name, lab results summary)
- Agent asks patient to confirm appointment or callback time
- Patient's responses recorded and processed
- Workflow continues based on patient's response

**Example:**
```
System (AI Agent): "Hi Sarah, this is Dr. Kumar's office with your lab results. Your cholesterol is slightly elevated at 245. 
Would you like to book a follow-up? We have slots on Monday at 10 AM, Wednesday at 2 PM, or Friday at 9 AM."

Patient: "Wednesday at 2 PM works."

System: "Great! I've scheduled you for Wednesday, March 20th at 2 PM. See you then!"
```

**Benefit:** Calls run **24/7 without staff**, handle 100+ patients simultaneously, can be run at scale.

---

### 3. **Google Calendar Integration** (Automatic appointment booking)
When patient confirms during the call → Clarus **automatically creates** the appointment in Google Calendar.
- No manual data entry
- Reduces double-booking errors
- Doctor sees calendar updated in real-time

---

### 4. **PDF Intake & Extraction** (Eliminate manual data entry)
Doctors can upload medical records/lab reports (PDF) → Clarus:
- Extracts patient info (name, DOB, MRN, insurance)
- Pulls lab results and values
- Auto-creates/updates patient records in the system
- Can trigger workflows based on extracted data

**Example:** Upload a lab report PDF → System extracts abnormal results → Automatically initiates "abnormal result detected" workflow.

---

### 5. **Patient & Condition Management**
Full CRUD for:
- **Patient records:** demographics, insurance, MRN, risk level
- **ICD-10 conditions:** with HCC categories and RAF scoring
- **Medications:** dosage, frequency, prescriber, status
- **Lab results & orders** (from PDF or manual entry)

**Benefit:** Single source of truth for all patient data; easily reviewable before call.

---

### 6. **Audit Trail & Call Transcripts**
Every workflow execution is logged:
- Call transcripts (word-for-word what AI said + patient response)
- Step-by-step execution logs (which nodes ran, what actions took)
- Timestamps and outcomes
- Reports can be generated for compliance/quality assurance

**Benefit:** Full HIPAA/PIPEDA compliance audit trail.

## 🚀 Example Workflow in Action

### **"Lab Result Follow-Up" Workflow**

```
1. TRIGGER: Lab results for patient "John Smith" received in system

2. CONDITION CHECK:
   - Is patient age > 50? YES → continue
   - Is cholesterol > 240? YES → continue

3. ACTION: Call patient
   - ElevenLabs initiates call to John's phone
   - Agent says: "Hi John, this is Dr. Kumar's office with your lab results. 
     Your cholesterol is 265, which is elevated. We recommend a follow-up."
   - John says: "OK, when can I come in?"
   - Agent: "How about next Tuesday at 2 PM?"
   - John: "That works."

4. ACTION: Schedule appointment
   - Automatically creates event in Dr. Kumar's Google Calendar

5. ACTION: Send SMS
   - John gets confirmation text: "Appointment confirmed for Mar 25 at 2 PM"

6. ACTION: Create lab order
   - System creates a follow-up lipid panel order

7. OUTPUT: Generate report
   - Transcript saved: "Call duration 2 min, patient confirmed appointment"
   - Audit log updated

8. COMPLETE ✓
   - Doctor sees all this in dashboard; John gets appointment in his calendar
```

## 💡 Why This Matters

**Before Clarus:**
- Lab result arrives Monday 9 AM
- Front desk reviews Friday afternoon (4-day delay)
- Front desk calls John; gets voicemail (1st attempt fails)
- Calls again Tuesday; gets John
- Manually schedules appointment
- Sends email confirmation (patient misses it)
- John doesn't show up; lab result is lost

**Cost:** 1-2 hours of front desk time + missed follow-up = lost revenue + patient health impact

**After Clarus:**
- Lab result arrives Monday 9 AM
- Workflow auto-triggers
- AI calls John Monday 10 AM (during business hours)
- John confirms appointment
- Calendar synced, SMS confirmation sent
- John shows up
- Follow-up completed in 60 seconds
- No staff involvement

**Cost:** $0.50-2.00 per call (depends on volume) + full audit trail

## 📈 Market Opportunity

### **Total Addressable Market (TAM):**
- **Canada:** ~13,000 medical clinics
- **North America:** ~200,000 clinics
- **Global:** ~1+ million clinics

### **Use Cases Beyond Follow-Up:**
1. **Appointment reminders** (reduce no-shows by 30-40%)
2. **Insurance pre-auth calls** (verify coverage before procedures)
3. **Patient surveys** (collect feedback after visits)
4. **Medication reminders** (AI calls patient to confirm meds taken)
5. **Prescription refill automation** (patient confirms, system auto-refills)
6. **Pre-visit screening** (collect patient history before appointment)

---

## 🔐 Compliance & Security

- **HIPAA** (US) / **PIPEDA** (Canada) compliant architecture
- **Auth0** for secure authentication
- **Supabase RLS** for row-level data isolation
- **Encrypted** patient data in transit and at rest
